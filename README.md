# Sarcasm as a Service
An API written with Mule that generates sarcastic sentences in compliance with the Sarcastic Spongebob Protocol. Basically it's this: https://stopthatrightnow.github.io/ as a service, which is what everyone wanted anyway. Be careful with weird characters (seriously, I'm not being sarcastic this time).

## Example:

### Request: 
http://<host>/api/sarcasm?input=Hello world!

### Response:
hElLO wORld!
